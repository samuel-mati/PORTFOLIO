# 🩺 Web Scraping Project: U.S. Infusion Centers Locator (Jupyter Notebook)

This project, developed in a **Jupyter Notebook**, demonstrates how to automate the extraction of healthcare facility data from the [Infusion Center Locator](https://locator.infusioncenter.org/). It scrapes infusion center names and addresses across the United States using Selenium, and saves them into a structured Excel file for analysis.

## 📘 Project Summary

- **Notebook Name:** `infusion_center_scraper.ipynb`
- **Goal:** Scrape all infusion center names and addresses across the U.S. and store the data in an Excel file.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for healthcare accessibility research, public health mapping, or portfolio demonstration.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Navigate the Infusion Center Locator website using Selenium.
- Trigger the full search and load all dynamic results.
- Extract each center's name and address.
- Export the results to `infusion_centers_all.xlsx`.
- Demonstrate clean and modular scraping logic within a notebook environment.
